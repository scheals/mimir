# Mimir

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Mimirs know a lot and I need this Mimir to remove columns, whole words and replace whole words or parts of them so my `.csv` imports to [Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/) are easy.

So what is this supposed to do? Grab a `.csv`, a YAML and based on the YAML change the entries in the `.csv` so I don't have to manipulate things in Buckets.

This wouldn't be needed if my bank statements were consistent and didn't have weird information on them but I guess that's what you get for the ease of paying over Internet.

Why is this not created as if it were a gem? Because I'm lazy. Also, there's perhaps a gem that does this already anyway. Let me have my fun.
